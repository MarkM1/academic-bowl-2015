The project contained in this repository is a set of python scripts to handle the 2015 Academic Bowl at Father Judge High School.  The first script, game.py, runs on a raspberry pi and handles
buttons presses by the game contestants.  It repsonds to these buttons by lighting up certain LEDs on the contestants tables, and on the operator table.  The second script, display.py, runs on the
PC.  This program will display the questions and scores.
